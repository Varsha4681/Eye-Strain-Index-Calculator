# Eye-Strain-Index-Calculator
A real-time eye strain monitoring system using Arduino and OpenCV. Measures ambient light (BH1750), viewing distance (HC-SR04), and blink rate (EAR-based CV model) to compute a quantitative Eye Strain Index (ESI). Integrates embedded sensing with computer vision for ergonomic and biomedical applications.
